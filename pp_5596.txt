
Step 1: Make sure you have 5 files when you unzip the "pp_5596.zip". The five files are
	1) henc_5596.java
	2) hdec_5596.java
	3) node_5596.java
	4) pqueue_5596.java
	5) pp-5596.txt (you are reading this file!)

Step 2: After Step 1 is successful, you need to copy the files with ".java" extension to afs machine or any other 		machine which can run java programs.

Step 3: After Step 2, (I make an assumption that you have copied the files) compile the ".java" files. For this you 	need to use the following command-line arguments:
		1) Paste "javac henc_5596.java" and press Enter. 
		2) Now paste "javac hdec_5596.java" and press Enter. Hopefully they compile without any problem.
	NOTE: You do not have to compile "node_5596.java" and "pqueue_5596.java". It gets automatically compiled.

Step 4: After Step 3 is successfully completed, you can give your test files as mentioned below.
	Steps:
	a) Take the file which you want to compress and place it in the same folder where you have placed the 			".java" files. Lets say the name of the file is "xyz.pdf". In the command line you need to paste 
	"java henc_5596 xyz.txt" and press Enter. Rename the original file to "xyz_original.txt"
	b) As a result of step a, we can find a new file in the same folder with ".huf" extension. In this example 		we can find "xyz.pdf.huf". This means that the file got compressed successfully. 
	c) Now, for decompression, we need to paste "java hdec_5596 xyz.pdf.huf" in the command line and press 		Enter. If the file exists, the code deletes the original file and regenerates a new file with same name.		(here it is xyz.txt).
	d) Now, use "diff" command. Here, we use "diff cs610_original.txt xyz.txt", if the original file and the 		file created in step c are different, we get a message that those files differ.

Notes:
-> For small files the compression is not worth it. Sometimes you get the compressed file of the same size as that of the original file.
-> You will see great results when you input >3MB for text file. 
-> The code works on any input file
